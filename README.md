Abstract: Counting the number of possible tilings on a certain region is a problem that can be reformulated as the problem of counting perfect matchings on the pertinent dual graph. In this paper, we review some basic results, models and algorithms related to the dimer covering problem in order to study the random dimer problem on a very particular graph -- the weighted Aztec graph. Not only we analysed the optimal solution at $T = 0$, but also explored the weighted Aztec graph at finite temperature regimes. Our intuition was that, in principle, the non-weighted Aztec diamond graph problem would be equivalent to the weighted one when averaging over many instances in the thermodynamic limit. However, it was shown that the arctic circle phenomenon does not arise for low temperatures in the weighted version.
